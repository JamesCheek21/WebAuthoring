                <p>In April 1994, Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan and became the home of New York City skate culture. <br> At its core was the gang of rebellious young New York skaters and artists who became the store's staff, crew and customers. </p>
                <p>Supreme grew to be the embodiment of the downtown culture, playing an integral part in its constant regeneration. Skaters, punks, hip-hop heads - the young counter culture at large - all gravitated towards Supreme. </p>
                <p>While it grew into a downtown institution, Supreme established itself as a brand known for its quality, style and authenticity. </p>
                <p>Over its eighteen year history, Supreme has worked with some of our generation's most groundbreaking designers, artists, photographers and musicians - all who have helped continue to define its unique identity and attitude.</p>
